## ORANGE Scenario — Reputation of the ORANGE Zone

I am the N/B Guild’s information broker—a traveler of roads.
Today again, I crossed a dangerous boundary, tracing the footprints of data and trade.

That place was the ORANGE zone.
On the surface, it seemed like an ordinary market, but something unsettling was unfolding within.

“Server lock! Withdrawals blocked for 12 hours!”
“Why was there no warning?”

The voices of the merchants were filled with anger and despair.
The behavior of certain exchanges conflicted with the N/B Guild’s principles, and a current of hostility toward the Guild could even be felt among some trading factions.

I recorded everything and returned to Guild headquarters.

### Guild Meeting
Senior stewards gathered to review the report.

Information Broker (me):
“The ORANGE zone isn’t merely a risky area. Exchange operations are unstable, trust is eroding, and hostility from some merchant groups is clearly surfacing. This could escalate into broader conflict.”

Steward A:
“So you’re suggesting we avoid branding it an enemy territory outright, but approach with extreme caution?”

Steward B:
“Yet if server locks continue, N/B members will suffer severe damage. Ultimately, we’ll have to classify it as both a restricted-access advisory zone and a high-risk zone.”

Steward C:
“Agreed. This isn’t just about risk; it ties directly to guild reputation. The ORANGE zone’s impression is already poor—among our members it will stand as a symbol of distrust.”

### Final Record
- The ORANGE zone requires exceptionally cautious engagement.
- Certain exchanges have lost credibility due to server locks (up to 12 hours).
- Hostile dynamics between some merchant factions and the N/B Guild are prevalent.
- Accordingly, the Guild classifies this zone as both a restricted-access advisory zone and a risk zone.
- The Guild’s reputation toward the ORANGE zone is now firmly negative.

I signed the document and muttered to myself:

“The ORANGE zone… even a brief stay is difficult. What remains under the Guild’s name now are distrust and vigilance.”


### Addendum — Guild Actions and System Update
In response to the ORANGE Scenario, the N/B Guild enacted immediate operational and learning updates to protect members and align strategy with the narrative evidence:

- Narrative Ingestion and Learning
  - A narrative pipeline was established to ingest field reports like this scenario and adjust zone reputation scores.
  - ORANGE zone reputation was set to negative, reflecting server locks, operational instability, and hostile dynamics.

- Zone Reputation and Guidance
  - The Guild maintains a reputation index for each zone (range −1 to +1). The ORANGE score turned negative, signaling caution and distrust.
  - The Village Elder and resident Trainers consult this reputation in their decision making. In practice, negative ORANGE reputation penalizes buy-leaning strategies inside ORANGE segments.

- Council and Trainers
  - The Village Council aggregates per-interval trainer suggestions to form a consensus intent (BUY/SELL/HOLD) while honoring feasibility (treasury, inventory) and reputation.
  - Trainer heads (trend/mean-reversion/breakout/pullback) now downweight actions that conflict with negative zone reputation.

- Broadcast and Records
  - The narrative is recorded in the Guild’s archive and broadcast as short NPC updates to keep all residents informed.
  - The system preserves a timestamped record of narrative ingestion and the resulting reputation shift for auditability.

- Policy Outcome
  - The classification stands: ORANGE is a restricted-access advisory zone and a risk zone.
  - Operational guidance: minimize exposure inside ORANGE, avoid impulsive entries, and require stronger confirmation (or abstain) when the Elder’s reputation guidance is negative.
