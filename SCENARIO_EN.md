## Chapter 2 — The Heart of a Moving Village

- Present Anchorage: on the seam of minute-candles, where a pale tide folds in
- Current Zone: BLUE dominant; a distant ORANGE swell is forming
- Village Energy (E): 53.7 — slowly recovering
- Treasury: 1,250,000 KRW, Coins: 0 (first coin is the spark we seek)
- Elder’s Broadcast: “BUY only in BLUE, SELL only in ORANGE. Today, we wait for pullback confirmation.”

### The Elder (Guild Branch Chief)
- Compass, accountant, and expedition captain in one.
- Calls: “Zone BLUE, slope +1.1 bp/bar, no nearby flip expected.”
- Rule of thumb: BUY-in-BLUE, SELL-in-ORANGE (a directive, not an absolute law).
- Treasury audits: KRW balance, coin inventory, and the fixed coin price (~5,100 KRW) are kept live.
- Consequences and rewards:
  - If a villager defies guidance and realizes a loss, coin count may go negative (penalty grows on violations).
  - On profitable cycles, Energy E replenishes; notable deeds are announced in the square.
- Energy rites:
  - Low E (<30): tighten gates (require Zone-100% and pullback confirmation).
  - Very low E (≤5): temporary trading halt; refit the treasury and regroup.

### The Residents (Four Strategy Heads)
- Trend Follower: “Ride with the wind.” Leads when slope and zone align.
- Mean Reversion Adept: “Wait for the return of the tide.” Looks for BLUE pullbacks to buy.
- Breakout Seeker: “The threshold breaks only once.” Watches the edges for decisive breaks.
- Pullback Sentinel: “After extremes, seek confirmation.” Acts on extreme-gap and age gates.
- Autonomy and learning:
  - They listen to the Elder, but act only when finance, energy, and confirmation gates align.
  - In live mode, insufficient KRW or zero inventory becomes a self-check (BUY× / SELL×).
  - After the very first BUY, they take a short REST (REST_BARS) — the “breathing rite.”

### The March (How the Village Moves)
- The village is a vessel on market waves; every bar is a temporary homeland.
- The cycle per bar:
  1) Mooring: Elder declares zone, slope, and flip ETA.
  2) Foraging: BLUE favors BUY; ORANGE favors SELL.
  3) Settlement: coin/energy updated by realized PnL and discipline.
  4) Departure: new bar opens; the caravan moves.
- Fuel: Energy E
  - Drains with time and failed/blocked attempts.
  - Recovers on disciplined, profitable trades.

### The Ledger — N/B COIN S.L
- Each timeframe has a card that records: what we did, or why we did not.
- Card fields:
  - side: BUY / SELL / NONE (per bar)
  - reasons: cooldown, zone100 unmet, finance blocked, energy rest/low, etc.
  - coin accounting: BUY +1; on SELL — profit +1, loss −1 (negative allowed).
- The current timeframe is featured at the top, full-width, double-height — the village’s beating heart.

### A Day’s Rituals
- Dawn: Energy check and Elder’s guidance — “BLUE today; we buy only after a verified pullback.”
- Morning: Mean reversion leads; once the first coin is earned, a brief REST follows.
- Afternoon: If momentum strengthens, Trend takes point while Breakout watches thresholds.
- Evening: Settlement — adjust Energy, announce merits and lessons, and scout the next anchorage.

### Market Weather
- Storm (volatility spike): Elder hardens guards; residents step back unless confirmation is strong.
- Turbulence (thin liquidity): recall the 5,000 KRW minimums and partial-reserve rules.
- Guiding Stars (multi-timeframe consensus): when timeframes agree, the expedition advances.

### Next Hooks
- Day Expedition: train the Day model and stock Energy for long sailing.
- Discipline Renewal: re-educate violators and temper penalties through collective rites.
- Energy Tithe: pledge a portion of gains back into Energy — a village-wide vow.
- Inter-Card Council: knowledge-sharing between timeframe trainers to coordinate stratagems.

The village stands at the lip of a BLUE morning. The Elder speaks:
“Do not rush before confirmation. Today’s Energy will be the shape of our tomorrow.”
