## The Moving Village of the N/B Guild — BTC‑Chasing, Ruin‑Refit Settlement (Village‑Only Scenario)

### Identity
- Affiliation: N/B Guild (discipline: NB‑wave)
- Origin: a high‑drain ruined settlement rebuilt into a mobile village — modular outer plating, decks, card slots, legged chassis, pipes and valves

### Core Discipline
- Navigate by NB‑wave: current zone (ORANGE/BLUE), extremes, pullback, flip ETA
- Operate on Energy E (0–100): time decay + losses/violations drain; profits/discipline/rest recharge

### BTC Tracker
- The village constantly seeks Bitcoin markets.
- Bitcoin markets are “off‑map” zones — airborne fortresses, remote sea isles, nomad outposts — pioneered by guilds and coalitions across the world.
- The village follows Bitcoin signals (zone/slope/pullback), enters a BTC market to BUY coins, then travels to another market/village to SELL and realize spread.
- A portion of realized profit is tithed to the N/B Guild.

### Core Organs (Systems)
1) E‑Core (Energy Heart): propulsion fuel for movement (0–100)
2) N/B Mast (Nav Tower): projects NB‑wave signals/confirmations
3) Coin Crucible: converts realized profit into fuel warrants (coin → E)
4) Pullback Clutch: engages drive only under confirmation (pullback/extreme‑age)
5) Zone Shield: blocks mis‑actions against the active zone
6) Gait Engine: bar‑closed “jumps” from one anchorage to the next
7) S.L Dock (Memory Dock): per‑timeframe cards logging side/NONE, reasons, coin accounting

### Voyage Cycle (per bar)
- Mooring (check zone/slope) → Forage (seek BUY/SELL) → Settle (update coins/E) → Jump (next anchorage)
- Low E: enforce Zone‑100% and pullback confirmation; Very low E: halt/maintenance
- High E: expand gradually only in high‑edge setups (discipline required)

### Safety / Adaptation
- Leg stroke adapts to rough terrain; overheat cutoffs; minimum reserves for fuel/coins
- Multi‑timeframe antennae and long‑range (Day) sailing kits are pluggable

### One‑Line Declaration
- “We are a BTC‑chasing moving village walking off the map — we run on confirmation, breathe in Energy, and live with our Guild.”

### The Ledger — N/B COIN S.L
- Each timeframe has a card that records: what we did, or why we did not.
- Card fields:
  - side: BUY / SELL / NONE (per bar)
  - reasons: cooldown, zone100 unmet, finance blocked, energy rest/low, etc.
  - coin accounting: BUY +1; on SELL — profit +1, loss −1 (negative allowed).
- The current timeframe is featured at the top, full-width, double-height — the village’s beating heart.

### A Day’s Rituals
- Dawn: Energy check and Elder’s guidance — “BLUE today; we buy only after a verified pullback.”
- Morning: Mean reversion leads; once the first coin is earned, a brief REST follows.
- Afternoon: If momentum strengthens, Trend takes point while Breakout watches thresholds.
- Evening: Settlement — adjust Energy, announce merits and lessons, and scout the next anchorage.

### Market Weather
- Storm (volatility spike): Elder hardens guards; residents step back unless confirmation is strong.
- Turbulence (thin liquidity): recall the 5,000 KRW minimums and partial-reserve rules.
- Guiding Stars (multi-timeframe consensus): when timeframes agree, the expedition advances.

### Next Hooks
- Day Expedition: train the Day model and stock Energy for long sailing.
- Discipline Renewal: re-educate violators and temper penalties through collective rites.
- Energy Tithe: pledge a portion of gains back into Energy — a village-wide vow.
- Inter-Card Council: knowledge-sharing between timeframe trainers to coordinate stratagems.

The village stands at the lip of a BLUE morning. The Elder speaks:
“Do not rush before confirmation. Today’s Energy will be the shape of our tomorrow.”
